# WEB : **Portfolio** web application

## Project description

This is a portfolio web application. I decided to build portfolio with a simple design using tailwind css.
my main idea is to have the most simple design as possible. This portfolio will show details about my (or users) development stack.
For coming version i'll add another views.

> This project is developed using laravel and tailwind css
